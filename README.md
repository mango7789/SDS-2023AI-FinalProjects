# SDS-2023AI-FinalProjects
> This is a repository containing all codes/reports/images of the three-phase FinalProject in Artifical Intelligence(DATA130008.01). All the agents in this project are submitted and evaluated via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## FinalProject1
- Adapted from the [Connect X](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx) competition in Kaggle.
- You need to implement a MCTS(Monte Carlo Tree Search) agent for the game.
- Guides and tutorials can be found [here](https://github.com/Dasher-mango/SDS-2023AI-FinalProjects/tree/main/FinalProject1/guide). 

## FinalProject2
- You need to choose one game from [Connect X](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx), [Santa](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2020), [Kore](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kore-2022) and [Lux AI](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021) to implement a RL(Reinforcement Learning) agent.
- The RL method should be based on value/policy iteration in this phase.
- Guides and tutorials can be found [here](https://github.com/Dasher-mango/SDS-2023AI-FinalProjects/tree/main/FinalProject2/tutorial). 

## FinalProject3
- You need to make a poster and give a presentation in no more than 2 minutes to clarify your agent implemented in FinalProject2.
- The method is not confined to value/policy iteration any more. Any method is allowed in this phase.
- Requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/Dasher-mango/SDS-2023AI-FinalProjects/blob/main/FinalProject3/Final%20Project%20presentation.pdf).

## Kaggle Results
We choose [Santa](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2020) in phase 2. The best agents of our team in [Connect X](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx) and  [Santa](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2020) all rank second in the leaderboard. Below are the tables display the Kaggle scores of our submissions.
